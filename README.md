**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**

The client, DriverPass, hired us for development of a system that will provide online and offline access of driver training to assist in preparing student drivers for their driver’s examination test. The system is a web-based application that allows customers to schedule and cancel appointments with specific drivers through a calendar application, as well as track their progress with DriverPass.

**What did you do particularly well?**

I think I did an excelent job with business requirements documents; defining customer needs, and outlining objectives and goals as well as categorizing functional and nonfunctional requirements for the project.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

If I could revise any part of these documents, I would improve the thoroughness of my system UML use case diagram. Though I did outline the functionality of the sytem in very high level terms, there is definitely room for the addition of more detail.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

When interpreting the user's needs, it is imperative that we translate what they are telling us they want the end result of the system to be into actual actionable steps that can be managed within a timeframe. For instance, the customer is not specifically going to tell you that they want a systems admin or IT support, but those features were taken into consideration during the design process. These considerations, as well as open communication about goals and limitations, will ultimately lead to a more satisfied customer receiving the product that they anticipate.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

Software design, for me, begins with confirming a thorough understanding of the customer's needs. Once those needs are understood, and limitations have been communicated, then high level system design can begin. From there, breaking down design tasks into smaller goals can help further outline a specific calendar for rolling out software. In the future, I can see myself using a Gantt chart more often, and more closely, to establish timelines for specific objectives. Activity, and particularly sequence diagrams, are extremely helpful tools that I will be adding to my tools for system design going forward.
